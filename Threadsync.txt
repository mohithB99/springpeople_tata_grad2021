Exercise Objective(s):Synchronization

Exercise:Write an application to simulate the vehicles crossing a bridge and a toll plaza on a highway.
 For the purpose of this exercise, simulate the environment for five vehicles that are 
approaching the bridge and the toll booth. The vehicles are numbered from one to five. The 
vehicles should approach the bridge and the toll booth in sequential order. The toll booth can 
only deal with one vehicle at a time. This application should print a message every time when 
a vehicle crosses the bridge and another message when a vehicle crosses the toll booth along 
with the vehicle number.

Recommended duration: 20 Mins

Solution Guidance (if applicable):The simulation is performed by having one thread for each vehicle.
and consists of four classes:
-Vehicle: Simulate the behavior of a vehicle
-Bridge:Simulate the behavior of a Bridge
-TollBooth: Simulate the behavior of a TollBooth
-Simulate: creates the vehicles and controls the simulation.
